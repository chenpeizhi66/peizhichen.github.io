I'm a graduate student from [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and software development. I also like photography, music, and traveling, feel free to check out my works here [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pez_chen/).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html) of CERLAB Lab from [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/)
